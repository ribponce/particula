Let's have a look in Houdini at how to make a procedural painterly normals setup, recently made famous by Cody Dingy.

# Houdini Morse Machine

In this video I walk you through a setup which converts any text into Morse code. Additionally, it will also generate the audio accordingly. Very interesting bits here, and it was particularly a challenge to learn a bit more how CHOPs work.

# Interactive Python States

In this video we take a look at python viewer states inside Houdini 18, and how its practicality can help technical artists develop interactive, easy-to-use tools for fast and smart content creation.

# Procedural Scatter

This write-up is divided into two parts. First we take a look at how to export multiple pieces of geometry most efficiently as sequence files. Later we go through building a small network that procedurally checks for inputs on disk and randomly pick items.

# Shortest Paths

[![Shortest Paths](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81909946/113515536-60a3ec80-9575-11eb-8ebd-713ad3aced19.jpg)](https://github.com/ribponce/particula/tree/master/tutorials/shortest_paths)

I was wondering for a while simple ways on how to generate roots or veins structures that possibly didnâ€™t rely on solvers. There is a very interesting node in Houdini called FindShortestPath which will basically search for the most optimal path between one or multiple start and end points on a given mesh.

# Procedural Modules

[![Procedural Modules](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81909946/113516152-060c8f80-9579-11eb-9f09-cebf2c3732a4.jpg)](https://github.com/ribponce/particula/tree/master/tutorials/procedural_modules)

Being able to copy any number of primitives from a selected pool to n points efficiently is something that comes up really often. Of course there are many ways of tackling any given problem, but this approach gives us the ability to further implement other core concepts that end up being essential for developing realistic modules.

# Recursive Voronoi

Welcome! In this quick video I walk you through this simple setup where we wrap a fracturing procedure inside a loop to have it repeat countless times. There are a few interesting bits on how to work with for-each and for loops, and I hope you can learn something from it.

# Unconventional k-d tree partitioning algorithm

[![180130_kdtree_02_edit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81909946/113516332-f772a800-9579-11eb-9bc4-4a74131f800a.jpg)](https://github.com/ribponce/particula/tree/master/tutorials/unconventional_k-d_tree_partitioning_algorithm)

Traditional K-dimensional algorithms will normally use neighbouring points to define the search trees and set its constraints. In this unconventional approach, we instead randomise the position of every perpendicular hyperplane that will split the current primitive into two at every iteration of a loop, for as many times as we want.
